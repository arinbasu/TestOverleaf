# Testing Overleaf and Juliabox

This is a github repository where i am going to test if I can use github and Overleaf at the same time.

The workflow wil be something like this:

## Plan A

1. First create a github repository
2. Then connect this repository to Overleaf.
3. Sync this repository to Juliabox
4. Create figures, codes, text in Juliabox
5. Check if Overleaf will automatically sync them
